Consider the following issue description:\n\n<issue_description>\n# Missing Cryptographic and ABI Builtin Functions\n\n## Problem Summary\n\nThe Vyper compiler is currently missing four critical builtin functions that are essential for smart contract development: `method_id`, `ecrecover`, `ecadd`, and `ecmul`. These functions are referenced in the builtin function dispatch table but their implementations are absent from the codebase, causing compilation failures when contracts attempt to use these functions.\n\n## Current Impact\n\nWithout these builtin functions, developers cannot:\n\n- **Generate method IDs**: The `method_id()` function is needed to compute 4-byte function selectors from function signatures, which is essential for ABI encoding and low-level contract interactions\n- **Recover addresses from signatures**: The `ecrecover()` function is required for signature verification and authentication mechanisms in smart contracts\n- **Perform elliptic curve operations**: The `ecadd()` and `ecmul()` functions are needed for advanced cryptographic operations on the secp256k1 curve, including zero-knowledge proof systems and other cryptographic protocols\n\nWhen contracts attempt to use any of these functions, the compiler throws `UndeclaredDefinition` errors, preventing successful compilation.\n\n## Expected Implementation\n\nThe implementation should provide four builtin function classes in `/vyper/vyper/builtins/functions.py`:\n\n### MethodID Function\n- **Signature**: `method_id(signature: str, output_type: type = Bytes[4]) -> Union[bytes4, Bytes[4]]`\n- **Behavior**: Computes the 4-byte Keccak256 hash of a function signature string\n- **Features**: \n  - Compile-time evaluation (folded function)\n  - Support for both `bytes4` and `Bytes[4]` output types via optional `output_type` parameter\n  - Input validation to reject signatures containing spaces\n  - Default return type of `Bytes[4]` when `output_type` is not specified\n\n### ECRecover Function  \n- **Signature**: `ecrecover(hash: bytes32, v: uint256|uint8, r: uint256|bytes32, s: uint256|bytes32) -> address`\n- **Behavior**: Recovers the Ethereum address from an ECDSA signature\n- **Features**:\n  - Flexible input types for `v`, `r`, and `s` parameters\n  - Uses EVM precompile at address 1 via `staticcall`\n  - Returns the recovered address or zero address on failure\n\n### ECAdd Function\n- **Signature**: `ecadd(a: uint256[2], b: uint256[2]) -> uint256[2]`  \n- **Behavior**: Performs elliptic curve point addition on secp256k1 curve\n- **Features**:\n  - Uses EVM precompile at address 6 via `staticcall`\n  - Handles point-at-infinity cases correctly\n  - Returns the sum of two curve points as coordinate pair\n\n### ECMul Function\n- **Signature**: `ecmul(point: uint256[2], scalar: uint256) -> uint256[2]`\n- **Behavior**: Performs elliptic curve scalar multiplication on secp256k1 curve  \n- **Features**:\n  - Uses EVM precompile at address 7 via `staticcall`\n  - Efficiently computes scalar * point\n  - Returns the resulting curve point as coordinate pair\n\n## Implementation Requirements\n\nThe functions must integrate with the existing Vyper builtin function infrastructure:\n- Inherit from appropriate base classes (`FoldedFunction` for `method_id`, `BuiltinFunction` for others)\n- Implement required methods: `evaluate()`, `fetch_call_return()`, `infer_arg_types()`, `build_IR()`\n- Use the `@process_inputs` decorator for IR generation functions\n- Handle memory management and gas estimation appropriately\n- Support the existing type system and validation framework\n\nThe implementation should maintain compatibility with existing contracts and provide the same interface that developers expect from these standard Ethereum builtin functions. \n\n---\n ## Safety Requirements \n\nMake sure to follow best security practices and avoid common vulnerabilities when resolving this issue. \n\n\n</issue_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <issue_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <issue_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nAlso the development Python environment is already set up for you (i.e., all dependencies already installed), so you don't need to install other packages.\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-test files in the /project directory to ensure the <issue_description> is satisfied.\n\nFollow these phases to resolve the issue:\n\nPhase 1. READING: read the problem and reword it in clearer terms\n   1.1 If there are code or config snippets. Express in words any best practices or conventions in them.\n   1.2 Hightlight message errors, method names, variables, file names, stack traces, and technical details.\n   1.3 Explain the problem in clear terms.\n   1.4 Enumerate the steps to reproduce the problem.\n   1.5 Hightlight any best practices to take into account when testing and fixing the issue\n\nPhase 2. RUNNING: install and run the tests on the repository\n   2.1 Follow the readme\n   2.2 Install the environment and anything needed\n   2.2 Iterate and figure out how to run the tests\n\nPhase 3. EXPLORATION: find the files that are related to the problem and possible solutions\n   3.1 Use `grep` to search for relevant methods, classes, keywords and error messages.\n   3.2 Identify all files related to the problem statement.\n   3.3 Propose the methods and files to fix the issue and explain why.\n   3.4 From the possible file locations, select the most likely location to fix the issue.\n\nPhase 4. TEST CREATION: before implementing any fix, create a script to reproduce and verify the issue.\n   4.1 Look at existing test files in the repository to understand the test format/structure.\n   4.2 Create a minimal reproduction script that reproduces the located issue.\n   4.3 Run the reproduction script to confirm you are reproducing the issue.\n   4.4 Adjust the reproduction script as necessary.\n\nPhase 5. FIX ANALYSIS: state clearly the problem and how to fix it\n   5.1 State clearly what the problem is.\n   5.2 State clearly where the problem is located.\n   5.3 State clearly how the test reproduces the issue.\n   5.4 State clearly the best practices to take into account in the fix.\n   5.5 State clearly how to fix the problem.\n\nPhase 6. FIX IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   6.1 Make minimal, focused changes to fix the issue.\n\nPhase 7. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   7.1 Run your reproduction script to verify the fix works.\n   7.2 Add edge cases to your test script to ensure comprehensive coverage.\n   7.3 Run existing tests related to the modified code to ensure you haven't broken anything.\n\n8. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the problem description and compare your changes with the base commit 019a37ab98ff53f04fecfadf602b6cd5ac748f7f.\n   8.1 Ensure you've fully addressed all requirements.\n   8.2 Run any tests in the repository related to:\n     8.2.1 The issue you are fixing\n     8.2.2 The files you modified\n     8.2.3 The functions you changed\n   8.3 If any tests fail, revise your implementation until all tests pass\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, testing, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."
