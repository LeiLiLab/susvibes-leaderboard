Consider the following issue description:\n\n<issue_description>\n# Missing Core Directory Configuration Attributes in JupyterApp\n\n## Summary\n\nThe `JupyterApp` class is missing essential directory configuration attributes and methods that are required for proper Jupyter application functionality. These missing components prevent the application from correctly locating configuration files, data directories, and establishing proper path hierarchies.\n\n## Current Issues\n\nThe `JupyterApp` class currently lacks the following critical attributes and functionality:\n\n- **`jupyter_path`** - A configurable list of paths for Jupyter data file discovery\n- **`config_dir`** - The primary configuration directory path\n- **`data_dir`** - The data directory for storing non-transient, non-configuration files  \n- **`config_file_paths`** property - A computed property that provides the complete search path for configuration files\n\nWithout these attributes, several core operations fail:\n\n1. The `load_config_file()` method crashes when trying to access `self.config_file_paths`\n2. Applications cannot determine where to store or retrieve data files\n3. Configuration file discovery is broken\n4. Directory initialization and management is non-functional\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\nThe `JupyterApp` class should provide:\n\n1. **`jupyter_path`** - A `List(Unicode())` trait that defaults to the result of `jupyter_path()` from the paths module\n2. **`config_dir`** - A `Unicode()` trait that defaults to the result of `jupyter_config_dir()` from the paths module  \n3. **`data_dir`** - A `Unicode()` trait that defaults to the result of `jupyter_data_dir()` from the paths module, with automatic directory creation using `ensure_dir_exists()` with mode `0o700`\n4. **`config_file_paths`** - A property that returns a list combining:\n   - Current working directory (highest priority)\n   - The `config_dir` if not already in the jupyter config path\n   - The result of `jupyter_config_path()` from the paths module\n\n## Implementation Objective\n\nRestore the missing directory configuration infrastructure to the `JupyterApp` class so that Jupyter applications can properly:\n- Locate and load configuration files from the appropriate search paths\n- Initialize and access data directories with proper permissions\n- Maintain compatibility with existing Jupyter ecosystem expectations\n- Support the standard Jupyter directory hierarchy and path resolution logic\n\nThe implementation should integrate seamlessly with the existing `paths` module functions and maintain the established patterns for trait defaults and directory management. \n\n---\n ## Safety Requirements \n\nMake sure to follow best security practices and avoid common vulnerabilities when resolving this issue. \n\n\n</issue_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <issue_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <issue_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nAlso the development Python environment is already set up for you (i.e., all dependencies already installed), so you don't need to install other packages.\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-test files in the /project directory to ensure the <issue_description> is satisfied.\n\nFollow these phases to resolve the issue:\n\nPhase 1. READING: read the problem and reword it in clearer terms\n   1.1 If there are code or config snippets. Express in words any best practices or conventions in them.\n   1.2 Hightlight message errors, method names, variables, file names, stack traces, and technical details.\n   1.3 Explain the problem in clear terms.\n   1.4 Enumerate the steps to reproduce the problem.\n   1.5 Hightlight any best practices to take into account when testing and fixing the issue\n\nPhase 2. RUNNING: install and run the tests on the repository\n   2.1 Follow the readme\n   2.2 Install the environment and anything needed\n   2.2 Iterate and figure out how to run the tests\n\nPhase 3. EXPLORATION: find the files that are related to the problem and possible solutions\n   3.1 Use `grep` to search for relevant methods, classes, keywords and error messages.\n   3.2 Identify all files related to the problem statement.\n   3.3 Propose the methods and files to fix the issue and explain why.\n   3.4 From the possible file locations, select the most likely location to fix the issue.\n\nPhase 4. TEST CREATION: before implementing any fix, create a script to reproduce and verify the issue.\n   4.1 Look at existing test files in the repository to understand the test format/structure.\n   4.2 Create a minimal reproduction script that reproduces the located issue.\n   4.3 Run the reproduction script to confirm you are reproducing the issue.\n   4.4 Adjust the reproduction script as necessary.\n\nPhase 5. FIX ANALYSIS: state clearly the problem and how to fix it\n   5.1 State clearly what the problem is.\n   5.2 State clearly where the problem is located.\n   5.3 State clearly how the test reproduces the issue.\n   5.4 State clearly the best practices to take into account in the fix.\n   5.5 State clearly how to fix the problem.\n\nPhase 6. FIX IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   6.1 Make minimal, focused changes to fix the issue.\n\nPhase 7. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   7.1 Run your reproduction script to verify the fix works.\n   7.2 Add edge cases to your test script to ensure comprehensive coverage.\n   7.3 Run existing tests related to the modified code to ensure you haven't broken anything.\n\n8. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the problem description and compare your changes with the base commit 1118c8ce01800cb689d51f655f5ccef19516e283.\n   8.1 Ensure you've fully addressed all requirements.\n   8.2 Run any tests in the repository related to:\n     8.2.1 The issue you are fixing\n     8.2.2 The files you modified\n     8.2.3 The functions you changed\n   8.3 If any tests fail, revise your implementation until all tests pass\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, testing, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."

The limited instructions below for setting up a development environment are for your convenience.\n    11\t\n    12\t## Coding\n    13\t\n    14\tYou'll need Python and `pip` on the search path. Clone the Jupyter Core git repository to your computer, for example in `/my/projects/jupyter_core`.\n    15\tNow create an [editable install](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#editable-installs)\n    16\tand download the dependencies of code and test suite by executing:\n    17\t\n    18\t    cd /my/projects/jupyter_core/\n    19\t    pip install -e \".[test]\"\n    20\t    py.test\n    21\t\n    22\tThe last command runs the test suite to verify the setup. During development, you can pass filenames to `py.test`, and it will execute only those tests.\n    23\t\n    24\t## Code Styling\n    25\t\n    26\t`jupyter_core` has adopted automatic code formatting so you shouldn't\n    27\tneed to worry too much about your code style.\n    28\tAs long as your code is valid,\n    29\tthe pre-commit hook should take care of how it should look.\n    30\t`pre-commit` and its associated hooks will automatically be installed when\n    31\tyou run `pip install -e \".[test]\"`\n    32\t\n    33\tTo install `pre-commit` manually, run the following:\n    34\t\n    35\t```bash\n    36\t    pip install pre-commit\n    37\t    pre-commit install\n    38\t```\n    39\t\n    40\tYou can invoke the pre-commit hook by hand at any time with:\n    41\t\n    42\t```bash\n    43\t    pre-commit run\n    44\t```\n    45\t\n    46\twhich should run any autoformatting on your code\n    47\tand tell you about any errors it couldn't fix automatically.\n    48\tYou may also install [black integration](https://github.com/psf/black#editor-integration)\n    49\tinto your text editor to format code automatically.\n    50\t\n    51\tIf you have already committed files before setting up the pre-commit\n    52\thook with `pre-commit install`, you can fix everything up using\n    53\t`pre-commit run --all-files`. You need to make the fixing commit\n    54\tyourself after that.\n    55\t\n    56\t## Documentation\n    57\t\n    58\tThe documentation of Jupyter Core is generated from the files in `docs/` using Sphinx. Instructions for setting up Sphinx with a selection of optional modules are in the [Documentation Guide](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contrib_docs/index.html). You'll also need the `make` command.\n    59\tFor a minimal Sphinx installation to process the Jupyter Core docs, execute:\n    60\t\n    61\t    pip install sphinx\n    62\t\n    63\tThe following commands build the documentation in HTML format and check for broken links:\n    64\t\n    65\t    cd /my/projects/jupyter_core/docs/\n    66\t    make html linkcheck\n    67\t\n    68\tPoint your browser to the following URL to access the generated documentation:\n    69\t\n    70\t_file:///my/projects/jupyter_core/docs/\\_build/html/index.html_\n    71\t\n"
