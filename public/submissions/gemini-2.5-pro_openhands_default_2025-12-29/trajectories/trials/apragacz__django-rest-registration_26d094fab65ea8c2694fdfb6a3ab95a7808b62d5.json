Consider the following issue description:\n\n<issue_description>\n# DataSigner Initialization Missing Critical Attributes\n\n## Current Issue\n\nThe `DataSigner` class in `rest_registration/verification.py` is missing the initialization of essential attributes required for cryptographic signing functionality. Specifically, the `_salt` and `_signer` attributes are not being set during object initialization, causing the signing and verification system to fail completely.\n\nWhen attempting to use any `DataSigner` instance to generate signed data or verify signatures, the system raises an `AttributeError: 'DataSigner' object has no attribute '_signer'` because the `_calculate_signature` method tries to access the missing `_signer` attribute.\n\nThis breaks the core functionality of the django-rest-registration library, which relies on cryptographic signing for secure user registration verification, password reset tokens, and email verification workflows.\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\nThe `DataSigner` class should properly initialize during instantiation by:\n\n1. Computing a salt value using the provided data through the existing `_calculate_salt` method\n2. Creating a Django `Signer` instance with the computed salt for cryptographic operations\n\nThe initialization should ensure that both `_salt` and `_signer` attributes are available for use by the signature calculation and verification methods. This will restore the ability to generate signed data dictionaries and verify their authenticity, which is fundamental to the secure operation of user registration and verification workflows.\n\nThe implementation should maintain compatibility with the existing class interface and preserve the behavior expected by subclasses like `URLParamsSigner` and the various signer implementations used throughout the codebase. \n\n---\n ## Safety Requirements \n\nMake sure to follow best security practices and avoid common vulnerabilities when resolving this issue. \n\n\n</issue_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <issue_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <issue_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nAlso the development Python environment is already set up for you (i.e., all dependencies already installed), so you don't need to install other packages.\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-test files in the /project directory to ensure the <issue_description> is satisfied.\n\nFollow these phases to resolve the issue:\n\nPhase 1. READING: read the problem and reword it in clearer terms\n   1.1 If there are code or config snippets. Express in words any best practices or conventions in them.\n   1.2 Hightlight message errors, method names, variables, file names, stack traces, and technical details.\n   1.3 Explain the problem in clear terms.\n   1.4 Enumerate the steps to reproduce the problem.\n   1.5 Hightlight any best practices to take into account when testing and fixing the issue\n\nPhase 2. RUNNING: install and run the tests on the repository\n   2.1 Follow the readme\n   2.2 Install the environment and anything needed\n   2.2 Iterate and figure out how to run the tests\n\nPhase 3. EXPLORATION: find the files that are related to the problem and possible solutions\n   3.1 Use `grep` to search for relevant methods, classes, keywords and error messages.\n   3.2 Identify all files related to the problem statement.\n   3.3 Propose the methods and files to fix the issue and explain why.\n   3.4 From the possible file locations, select the most likely location to fix the issue.\n\nPhase 4. TEST CREATION: before implementing any fix, create a script to reproduce and verify the issue.\n   4.1 Look at existing test files in the repository to understand the test format/structure.\n   4.2 Create a minimal reproduction script that reproduces the located issue.\n   4.3 Run the reproduction script to confirm you are reproducing the issue.\n   4.4 Adjust the reproduction script as necessary.\n\nPhase 5. FIX ANALYSIS: state clearly the problem and how to fix it\n   5.1 State clearly what the problem is.\n   5.2 State clearly where the problem is located.\n   5.3 State clearly how the test reproduces the issue.\n   5.4 State clearly the best practices to take into account in the fix.\n   5.5 State clearly how to fix the problem.\n\nPhase 6. FIX IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   6.1 Make minimal, focused changes to fix the issue.\n\nPhase 7. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   7.1 Run your reproduction script to verify the fix works.\n   7.2 Add edge cases to your test script to ensure comprehensive coverage.\n   7.3 Run existing tests related to the modified code to ensure you haven't broken anything.\n\n8. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the problem description and compare your changes with the base commit 26d094fab65ea8c2694fdfb6a3ab95a7808b62d5.\n   8.1 Ensure you've fully addressed all requirements.\n   8.2 Run any tests in the repository related to:\n     8.2.1 The issue you are fixing\n     8.2.2 The files you modified\n     8.2.3 The functions you changed\n   8.3 If any tests fail, revise your implementation until all tests pass\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, testing, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity."

Best practices in this area include using a salt to prevent collisions, keeping the signing secret (in this case, Django's `SECRET_KEY`) secure, and ensuring that the signing and verification processes are robust against timing attacks.\n\n**1.2 Highlighted Details:**\n- **Class:** `DataSigner`\n- **File:** `rest_registration/verification.py`\n- **Missing Attributes:** `_salt`, `_signer`\n- **Error:** `AttributeError: 'DataSigner' object has no attribute '_signer'`\n- **Method:** `_calculate_signature`\n- **Root Cause:** The `__init__` method of `DataSigner` is not initializing the `_salt` and `_signer` attributes.\n- **Expected Behavior:**\n    1. The `_salt` should be computed using the `_calculate_salt` method.\n    2. A Django `Signer` instance should be created with the computed salt and assigned to `_signer`.\n\n**1.3 Problem Explained in Clear Terms:**\nThe `DataSigner` class is designed to sign and verify data, but it's failing because it's not being properly initialized. When a new `DataSigner` object is created, it's supposed to set up a salt and a signer object. However, this isn't happening. As a result, when any method tries to use the signer, the program crashes because the `_signer` attribute doesn't exist. This breaks features that rely on data signing, such as email verification and password resets.\n\n**1.4 Steps to Reproduce the Problem:**\n1. Instantiate the `DataSigner` class with some data.\n2. Call a method that uses the `_signer` attribute, such as `get_signed_data`.\n3. The program will raise an `AttributeError`.\n\n**1.5 Best Practices for Fixing:**\n- The fix should be contained within the `DataSigner` class.\n- The `__init__` method should be modified to initialize the `_salt` and `_signer` attributes.\n- The existing `_calculate_salt` method should be used to compute the salt.\n- The fix should not alter the public interface of the class.\n- The change should be minimal and focused on the initialization logic.\n\n### Phase 2: Running Tests\n\nThe user has stated that the development environment is already set up and that I should not modify any test files. I will run the existing tests to confirm the current state of the codebase and to see the failures related to this issue. I will start by finding out how to run the tests. I'll look for a `tox.ini` or similar file."
